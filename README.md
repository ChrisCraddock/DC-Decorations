# DC-Decorations
![BrickDisplay4](/Display/display4.png)

This small decorations modpack was created for those who just want to either have a different interior for their projects or want a more 'I.T./Data Center' feel.

### Minecraft Java ver: 1.16.5
### Forge ver: 36.2.0

## Contents:
* 64 brick blocks
* 1 door (iron)
  * (can only face and open 1 way right now)
* 2 servers
  * (2 blocks per server) [Luminance = 15]
* 1 UPS 
  * (UPS Screen [Luminance = 7]/UPS Panels/UPS Vent)
* 1 PDU 
  * (PDU Screen [Luminance = 7]/UPS Panels)
* 1 CRAC Unit 
  * (CRAC Screen [Luminance = 7]/UPS Panels/UPS Vent)

## Lifecycle
This pack was mainly meant to get me brainstorming for an original pack I was working on to integrate with ComputerCraft/ComputerCraftEdu or OpenComputers.
While I cannot *promise* that I will be regularly updating the pack with more and more DC themed items, I will add documentation of all the objects I used so
you can tweak things to your needs.  This is meant to be rather lightweight so it can be used with other packs and not be resource intensive. 

## Getting Started

* x1 brown dye and x1 vanilla brick will give you 16x Brown Bricks (same pattern on all sides)
* ![BasicBrownBrick](/Display/BasicBrownBrick.png)

* 1 white dye and 1 vanilla brick will give you 16x White Bricks (same pattern on all sides)
* ![BasicWhiteBrick](/Display/BasicWhiteBrick.png)

From here on, when crafting the color that you want, just use the dye of the color wanted along with either the White brick (for white walls or white walls and a stripe) or the Brown brick (for black walls or black walls and a stripe).  With the exception of 2 sets from each, the White group will have white mortar, and the Brown group will have black mortar.

# Brick Crafting Order Clarification
The 1st block in the group will contain a stripe. If you want the solid colored wall, just put it back into the crafting grid and you will get the solid version in the output. To get back to the solid white brick you started with initially after crafting, put the colored block back into the grid and you are back to a clean slate. NOTE: This is also an easy way to duplicate blocks as you get x16 bricks originally and then x8 dyed blocks per 1x dye + 1x brick.  However, This is not meant to be difficult and since it is only decorations, the majority of your time will be spent on other things and that is OK. The ONLY block that will not revert back is the basic white -> white brick w/ white walls. Think of it as a trade off for making duplications easy.
