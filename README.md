# DC-Decorations

This small decorations modpack was created for those who just want to either have a different interior for their projects or want a more 'I.T./Data Center' feel.

### Minecraft Java ver: 1.16.5
### Forge ver: 36.2.0

## Contents:
* 64 brick blocks
* 1 door
  * (can only face and open 1 way right now)
* 2 servers
  * (2 blocks per server) [Luminance = 15]
* 1 UPS 
  * (UPS Screen [Luminance = 7]/UPS Panels/UPS Vent)
* 1 PDU 
  * (PDU Screen [Luminance = 7]/UPS Panels)
* 1 CRAC Unit 
  * (CRAC Screen [Luminance = 7]/UPS Panels/UPS Vent)

## Lifecycle
This pack was mainly meant to get me brainstorming for an original pack I was working on to integrate with ComputerCraft/ComputerCraftEdu or OpenComputers.
While I cannot *promise* that I will be regularly updating the pack with more and more DC themed items, I will add documentation of all the objects I used so
you can tweek things to your needs.  This is meant to be rather lightweight so it can be used with other packs and not be resource intensive.
